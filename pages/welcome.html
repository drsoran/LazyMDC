  Welcome to Data Card Builder v2.
  </p>
  <p>
  This update is mostly about cleaning up the old one and making it a little
  more streamlined for making future additions and flows much easier to
  implement
  </p>
  <p>
  As a side effect, we've also moved to a more guided route through creating an
  MDC that should hopefully be far more intuitive and be able to add tooltips
  without it seeming to be overwhelming 
  </p>
  <p>
  Your MDC is automatically saved when you hit hext, and you can share the URL
  if you wish to pass on a partial kneeboard / collaborate (one at a time, as
  whoever saves next wins) 

  When you donwload a kneeboard then it'll snapshot the original so you don't
  need to worry about someone modifying it 
  </p>
  <p>
  Hope you like it!
