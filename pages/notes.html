      Inserting Images:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Imgur (preferred, and means your MDC saves quickly)
          <ul>
            <li>Upload to Imgur</li>
            <li>Right click the image on and 'copy image address' (otherwise you get a view url rather than an image url)
            <li>In the notes section use "Insert" -> "Image" and paste the URL into Source (expecting it to end in .jpg / .png etc)</li>
            <li>Hit Save</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Local File
          <ul>
            <li>Open the image in an image viewer such as "Photos", or perhaps from Snipping Tool or Snip and Sketch (area of Combat Flite perhaps)</li>
            <li>ctrl+c to copy the image data, select the notes text area and ctrl+v it</li>
            <li>NB: you might notice your save taking a while, as it's saving the image data each time!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Images will be resized, maintaining aspect ratio to fill the width or height of the available page
          <ul>
            <li>If you want side by side images, use a table</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Table Limitations
      <ul>
        <li>At the moment, tables will only be split between pages on a row by row basis
        <li>if you have tables with very large content / or nested tables then you may get funky results such as clipping off the page
      </ul>
      Page Breaks
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may have a notes section on page 1 with a few lines of content with the rest on page 2.<br>
          If you wish to push the first bit to make a nice self contained notes on page 2 
          <ul>
            <li>Use "Insert" -> "Page Break" as the first item and this will be honored</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Funky Formatted pastes from other apps such as discord etc
      <ul>
        <li>
          You might get dark backgrounds etc. to avoid this you can do any of the following
          <ul>
            <li>Paste as plain text (ctrl+shift+v)</li>
            <li>Paste into notepad.exe, then copy and paste as normal</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
